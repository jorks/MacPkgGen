==== WELCOME ====
This script will create a new GitHub repo to source control a macOS package.
It uses GitHub Workflows to build and release packages that are signed and notarized.
Hope you enjoy!

==== IMPORTANT ====
The script will create a new local git repository.
In order to push code to GitHub some additional configuration is required.

This script can automatically:
 -  Add a remote origin GitHub repository URL
 -  Push the initial commit into GitHub

This requires two important prerequisites:
 1. You can authenticate to GitHub via the command line
 2. You have already created an empty repository via the GitHub website

==== WARNING ====
There was an issue installing the pre-commit git hook.
This git hook is required to create a BOM file used to 
track permissions and empty folders. This is going to cause 
issues when you attempt to build packages with GitHub Actions.

You can fix this manually by copying the file:
    helpers/pre-commit
Into this hidden directory:
	.git/hooks/pre-commit
